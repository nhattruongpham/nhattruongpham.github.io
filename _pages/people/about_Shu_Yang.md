Dr. <a href="https://dbei.med.upenn.edu/staff/shu-yang-phd/">Shu (Simon) Yang</a> is a Postdoctoral Researcher in the <a href="https://dbei.med.upenn.edu/divisions/informatics/">Informatics Division</a> at the <a href="https://dbei.med.upenn.edu/">Department of Biostatistics, Epidemiology and Informatics (DBEI)</a>, working with Prof. <a href="https://dbei.med.upenn.edu/staff/li-shen-phd-faimbe/">Li Shen</a>. His research interests include computational biology, bioinformatics algorithm, data mining, and machine learning. He earned his Ph.D. in Computer Science from the University of British Columbia (UBC), where he studied under Professors Raymond Ng and Anne Condon. His research sits at the intersection of artificial intelligence and biomedical informatics, with a current focus on generative AI models for Alzheimer’s disease (AD) and RNA. At Penn, Dr. Yang is developing efficient model parameterization of deep neural networks to study brain imaging-genomics associations from multi-modality data (genotype, PET/MRI, etc.) for Alzheimer’s research. He also leads research projects leveraging large language models, tabular foundation models, and knowledge graphs to study AD through mining literature and EHR text, as well as biomarkers/imaging tabular data, which integrate additional moalities for AD research. Moreover, he is investigating RNA structure, regulation, and modifications using biological foundation models coupled with dynamic programming algorithms through neuro-symbolic frameworks, providing transcriptomic-level insights for AD. Dr. Yang is currently a <a href="https://www.pennaitech.org/innovationfellows">PennAITech Innovation Fellow</a>.
