**Short Bio:** My name is Nhat Truong. I am currently a first-year Ph.D. Student at the <a href="https://skb.skku.edu/eng_gene/index.do">Department of Integrative Biotechnology</a>, <a href="https://biotech.skku.edu/eng_biotech/index.do">College of Biotechnology and Bioengineering</a>, <a href="https://www.skku.edu/eng/">Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU)</a>. I am working under the guidance of Assistant Professor <a href="https://skb.skku.edu/eng_gene/faculty.do?mode=view&perId=LZStrB4DgrAqgzgNgwgGQCwGkAuArAigEQE4BCA5gHYBmMAnkQLw1A">Balachandran Manavalan</a> in the <a href="https://balalab-skku.org/">Computational Biology and Bioinformatics Laboratory</a>. Prior to joining SKKU, I worked as an Assistant Researcher at <a href="https://tdtu.edu.vn/en">Ton Duc Thang University (TDTU)</a>, Vietnam. I completed my M.E. degree in Automation and Control at TDTU, where I was supervised by Dr. <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/nguyensydzung">Sy Dzung Nguyen</a> and co-supervised by Dr. <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/dnmduc/">Duc Ngoc Minh Dang</a>. I also hold a B.E. degree in Electronics and Telecommunication from TDTU, which I obtained in 2019 under the supervision of Dr. <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/dnmduc/">Duc Ngoc Minh Dang</a>.

**Research Interests:** Applied Intelligence, Computational Intelligence, Deep Learning, Machine Learning, Signal Processing, XAI & Optimization, and their applications in the fields of Affective Computing, Bioinformatics, Computational Biology and Medicine, Computer-aided Drug Design, Protein Functional and Structural Prediction, and Healthcare.
