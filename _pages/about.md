My name is Nhat Truong. I am currently a first-year Ph.D. Student at the Department of Integrative Biotechnology, College of Biotechnology and Bioengineering, Sungkyunkwan University (SKKU). I am working under the guidance of Assistant Professor Balachandran Manavalan in the Computational Biology and Bioinformatics Laboratory. Prior to joining SKKU, I worked as an Assistant Researcher at Ton Duc Thang University (TDTU), Vietnam. I completed my M.E. degree in Automation and Control at TDTU, where I was supervised by Dr. Sy Dzung Nguyen and co-supervised by Dr. Duc Ngoc Minh Dang. I also hold a B.E. degree in Electronics and Telecommunication from TDTU, which I obtained in 2019 under the supervision of Dr. Duc Ngoc Minh Dang.
